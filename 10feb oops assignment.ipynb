    "# Q1. Which function is used to open a file? What are the different modes of opening a file? Explain each mode\n",
    "# of file opening.\n",
    "# Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "# The `open()` function is used to open a file and returns a file object that allows you to perform various operations on the \n",
    "# file, such as reading from it, writing to it, or both. When opening a file, you can specify different modes that define the\n",
    "# intended purpose of accessing the file. The available modes differ slightly depending on the programming language, but I'll\n",
    "# explain the most commonly used modes:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. **Read mode (`\"r\"`)**: This mode is used when you want to read data from a file. It is the default mode if no mode is \n",
    "#     explicitly specified. In read mode, attempting to write to the file will result in an error. The file pointer is positioned \n",
    "#     at the beginning of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. **Write mode (`\"w\"`)**: This mode is used when you want to write data to a file. If the file already exists, it gets\n",
    "#     truncated (emptied) before writing new data to it. If the file doesn't exist, a new file is created. If you open a \n",
    "#     file in write mode and it already contains data, that data will be lost. The file pointer is positioned at the beginning \n",
    "#     of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. **Append mode (`\"a\"`)**: This mode is used when you want to append data to an existing file. If the file doesn't exist,\n",
    "#     a new file is created. When writing in append mode, the file pointer is positioned at the end of the file, so any data\n",
    "#     you write will be added to the existing content.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. **Binary mode (`\"b\"`)**: This mode is used in conjunction with the read or write modes to indicate that the file should\n",
    "#     be handled as binary data, rather than text data. It is commonly used when dealing with non-text files such as images,\n",
    "#     videos, or binary file formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. **Update mode (`\"+\"`)**: This mode allows you to both read from and write to a file. For example, `\"r+\"` would enable \n",
    "#     you to read and write data, while `\"w+\"` would allow both reading and writing, with truncation of the file. The file\n",

    "# Q2. Why close() function is used? Why is it important to close a file?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Ans: The `close()` function is used to close a file that has been opened in a computer program. It is important to close\n",
    "#     a file for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Resource Management: When a file is opened, the operating system allocates certain resources to handle the file operations,\n",
    "#     such as memory buffers and file descriptors. If a file is not closed properly, these resources may remain allocated, \n",
    "#     leading to inefficient memory usage and potential resource leaks. Closing the file releases these resources, allowing \n",
    "#     them to be used by other parts of the program or other programs running on the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Data Integrity: When a file is closed, any pending writes or modifications are typically flushed to the disk, ensuring\n",
    "#     that the data is saved correctly. If a file is not closed properly, some of the changes made to the file may not be\n",
    "#     persisted, leading to data loss or inconsistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. File Locking: In some operating systems, when a file is open, it may be locked to prevent other programs from modifying\n",
    "#     it simultaneously. Closing the file releases this lock, allowing other programs to access and modify the file if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. Access by Other Programs: When a file is open, it may be inaccessible or read-only for other programs. Closing the file\n",
    "#     makes it available for other programs to read, write, or delete, if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "# 5. File System Limits: Operating systems usually impose limits on the number of files a program can have open simultaneously.\n",
    "#     By closing files that are no longer needed, you free up these limited resources and prevent potential errors or crashes \n",
    "#     due to exceeding the file system limits.\n",
