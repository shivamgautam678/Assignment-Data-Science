    "# Q1. What is Abstraction in OOPs? Explain with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Abstraction in object-oriented programming (OOP) is a fundamental principle that focuses on representing the essential features\n",
    "# and behaviors of an object while hiding unnecessary details. It allows us to create abstract classes and interfaces that define\n",
    "# a blueprint for derived classes to implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Abstraction helps in managing complexity by breaking down a system into smaller, more manageable parts. It allows us to create \n",
    "# high-level, conceptual models that hide the implementation details. The main goal of abstraction is to provide a simplified view\n",
    "# of an object or system, emphasizing only the necessary and relevant information.\n",
    "\n",
    "# For example, consider the concept of a \"Vehicle.\" A vehicle can be an abstract class that defines common properties and \n",
    "# behaviors shared by all types of vehicles, such as a car, a bike, or a truck. The abstract class \"Vehicle\" may have methods\n",
    "# like \"start_engine,\" \"stop_engine,\" and \"accelerate\" without specifying how each method is implemented. The derived classes,\n",
    "# like \"Car\" or \"Bike,\" will provide their specific implementations for these methods. The abstract class abstracts away the \n",
    "# implementation details and provides a generalized representation of a vehicle.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q2. Differentiate between Abstraction and Encapsulation. Explain with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Abstraction and encapsulation are two important concepts in object-oriented programming, but they serve different purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Abstraction focuses on hiding unnecessary details and providing a simplified representation of an object or system. \n",
    "# It allows us to define abstract classes and interfaces that specify the behavior and properties without getting into\n",
    "# the specific implementation. Abstraction deals with the \"what\" and \"why\" of an object or system.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Encapsulation, on the other hand, is about bundling related data and behavior into a single unit, known as a class.\n",
    "# It allows us to control the access to the internal state of an object, protecting it from external interference.\n",
    "# Encapsulation deals with the \"how\" of an object or system.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Here's an example to illustrate the difference:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Abstraction:\n",
    "# Let's consider the concept of a \"Shape.\" A shape can be abstractly defined with properties like \"area\" and \"perimeter.\" \n",
    "# We can have an abstract class called \"Shape\" that provides these properties as abstract methods, without specifying the\n",
    "# implementation details. Derived classes like \"Circle\" or \"Rectangle\" will inherit from the \"Shape\" class and provide their \n",
    "# specific implementations for calculating the area and perimeter.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Encapsulation:\n",
    "# Suppose we have a class called \"Person\" that represents a person's information. It may have private data members like name,\n",
    "# age, and address. We encapsulate these data members by providing public methods like \"setName,\" \"setAge,\" and \"setAddress\" \n",
    "# to access and modify them. This way, we can control how the internal state of the \"Person\" object is accessed and ensure that\n",
    "# it follows certain rules or restrictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q3. What is the abc module in Python? Why is it used?\n",
    "\n",
    "# The `abc` module in Python stands for \"Abstract Base Classes.\" It is a built-in module that provides mechanisms for defining \n",
    "# abstract base classes. Abstract base classes are classes that are meant to be inherited by other classes and serve as a \n",
    "# blueprint for their implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The `abc` module allows us to create abstract base classes by using the `ABC` class as a metaclass or by using the\n",
    "# `@abstractmethod` decorator. By defining abstract methods in these classes, we can specify a common interface that \n",
    "# the derived classes must implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The `abc` module is used to enforce a certain structure or behavior across multiple classes. It helps in achieving\n",
    "# abstraction and provides a way to define a common interface for a group of related classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q4. How can we achieve data abstraction?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Data abstraction in object-oriented programming refers to the concept of hiding the internal details\n",
    "\n",
    "#  of an object and providing only the essential information to the outside world. It allows us to separate the interface\n",
    "#     from the implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "# In many object-oriented languages, including Python, data abstraction can be achieved through the use of abstract classes\n",
    "# and interfaces. Abstract classes define the abstract methods that must be implemented by derived classes, while interfaces\n",
    "# specify a contract that implementing classes must adhere to.\n",
    "\n",
    "# To achieve data abstraction:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Define an abstract class or interface that declares the desired methods and properties without providing their\n",
    "# implementations.\n",
    "# 2. In the abstract class, mark the methods as abstract using the `@abstractmethod` decorator or by using the `ABC` metaclass.\n",
    "# 3. Create derived classes that inherit from the abstract class or implement the interface.\n",
    "# 4. Implement the abstract methods in the derived classes, providing the necessary logic and functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "# By following this approach, you can achieve data abstraction by defining a common interface that derived classes must\n",
    "# implement, while hiding the internal implementation details.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q5. Can we create an instance of an abstract class? Explain your answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "# No, we cannot create an instance of an abstract class. An abstract class is designed to be a blueprint or template for other\n",
    "# classes to inherit from and implement its abstract methods. It cannot be instantiated on its own because it may have incomplete\n",
    "# or undefined methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "# An abstract class can have both abstract methods (marked with `@abstractmethod`) and concrete methods (with implementations).\n",
    "# However, an abstract class must have at least one abstract method for it to be considered abstract.\n",
    "\n",
    "# To use an abstract class, you need to create a derived class that inherits from the abstract class and provides implementations'\n",
    "# for all the abstract methods. The derived class can then be instantiated and used.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Attempting to instantiate an abstract class directly will result in a `TypeError`. Abstract classes are meant to be extended \n",
    "# and provide a common interface, but they cannot be instantiated because they are incomplete and lack the necessary \n",
    "# implementations."
