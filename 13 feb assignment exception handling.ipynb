    "# Q1. When creating a custom exception in Python, it is recommended to use the Exception class as the base class for your custom exception. The Exception class serves as the parent class for all built-in exceptions in Python. By inheriting from the Exception class, your custom exception will inherit the behavior and attributes of the base class, which includes handling and propagating exceptions in a consistent manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using the Exception class as the base class for your custom exception allows you to take advantage of the existing exception handling mechanisms provided by Python. It ensures that your custom exception is compatible with the try-except statement and other exception-related constructs.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Additionally, using the Exception class makes your custom exception recognizable as an exception by other developers who are familiar with Python's exception hierarchy. It also allows you to catch your custom exception specifically or catch a broader category of exceptions if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example of creating a custom exception that inherits from the Exception class:\n",
    "\n",
    "# ```python\n",
    "# class CustomException(Exception):\n",
    "#     pass\n",
    "\n",
    "# try:\n",
    "#     raise CustomException(\"This is a custom exception.\")\n",
    "# except CustomException as e:\n",
    "#     print(\"Caught custom exception:\", str(e))\n",
    "# ```\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q2. To print the Python Exception Hierarchy, you can use the `help()` function or the `dir()` function on the `exceptions` module. Here's an example using `help()`:\n",
    "\n",
    "# ```python\n",
    "# help(Exception)\n",
    "# ```\n",
    "\n",
    "# This will display the documentation for the `Exception` class and its subclasses, providing you with an overview of the exception hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q3. The `ArithmeticError` class in Python defines errors that occur during arithmetic operations. It serves as the base class for more specific arithmetic-related exception classes. Two examples of errors defined in the `ArithmeticError` class are `ZeroDivisionError` and `OverflowError`.\n",
    "\n",
    "# - `ZeroDivisionError`: This error occurs when attempting to divide a number by zero. It is raised when the denominator of a division or modulo operation is zero. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "#   ```python\n",
    "#   try:\n",
    "#       result = 10 / 0\n",
    "#   except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "#       print(\"Cannot divide by zero!\")\n",
    "#   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "# - `OverflowError`: This error occurs when the result of an arithmetic operation is too large to be represented within the available numeric range. It typically happens with operations involving integers or floating-point numbers. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "#   ```python\n",
    "#   try:\n",
    "#       result = 999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999 + 1\n",
    "#   except OverflowError:\n",
    "#       print(\"Arithmetic operation resulted in an overflow!\")\n",
    "#   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q4. The `LookupError` class in Python is used as a base class for exceptions that occur when a key or index is not found in a mapping or sequence. It provides a common base class for exceptions like `KeyError` and `IndexError`. These exceptions are raised when a specified key or index is not found in a dictionary or sequence, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "# - `KeyError`: This error occurs when trying to access a non-existent key in a dictionary. It is raised when a dictionary is accessed using a key that does not exist in the dictionary. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "#   ```python\n",
    "#   my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}\n",
    "\n",
    "#   try:\n",
    "#       value = my_dict['c']\n",
    "#   except KeyError:\n",
    "#       print(\"Key does not exist in the dictionary!\")\n",
    "#   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "# - `IndexError`: This error occurs when trying to access an index that is out of range in a sequence like a list or a string. It is raised when the index used for accessing an element is either negative or greater than the length of the sequence. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "#   ```python\n",
    "#   my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "\n",
    "#   try:\n",

    "#   except IndexError:\n",
    "#       print(\"Index is out of range!\")\n",
    "#   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q5. `ImportError` is an exception raised when an import statement fails to find the module or the name being imported. It typically occurs when trying to import a module that does not exist or when importing a specific name from a module that does not define that name.\n",
    "\n",
    "# `ModuleNotFoundError` is a subclass of `ImportError` that specifically indicates that the module being imported could not be found. It was introduced in Python 3.6 as a more specific exception for handling cases where the module itself is not found.\n",
    "\n",
    "# For example, if you try to import a non-existent module:\n",
    "\n",
    "# ```python\n",
    "# try:\n",
    "#     import non_existent_module\n",
    "# except ModuleNotFoundError:\n",
    "#     print(\"Module not found!\")\n",
    "# ```\n",
    "\n",
    "# In this case, since the `non_existent_module` does not exist, a `ModuleNotFoundError` will be raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q6. Here are some best practices for exception handling in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Be specific in exception handling: Catch specific exceptions rather than using a generic `except` clause. This allows you to handle different exceptions differently and avoids masking other unexpected errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Use multiple except blocks: If you need to handle different exceptions in different ways, use multiple `except` blocks to catch and handle each specific exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Use finally block: When necessary, use the `finally` block to ensure that certain code gets executed regardless of whether an exception is raised or not. It is commonly used for releasing resources or cleaning up operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. Avoid bare except clauses: Avoid using a bare `except` clause without specifying the exception type. This can make it harder to debug and can lead to catching and handling unintended exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. Log exceptions: Use a logging framework to log exceptions and their traceback information. This helps in debugging and troubleshooting issues in production systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 6. Raise exceptions when appropriate: Raise built-in or custom exceptions when encountering exceptional conditions in your code. This allows you to signal errors or unexpected states to the caller of your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 7. Handle exceptions at the appropriate level: Handle exceptions at a level where you have enough context to handle or report the error effectively. Avoid catching exceptions too broadly at the top level, as it can make debugging and error analysis more difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 8. Use context managers (`with` statement): When working with resources that need proper cleanup, such as file handling or database connections, use context managers (`with` statement) to ensure that resources are properly released even if an exception occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 9. Follow the principle of EAFP (Easier to Ask for Forgiveness than Permission): It is a Pythonic approach where you assume that the required resources or conditions are available and try to perform the desired operation. If an exception occurs, you handle it gracefully rather than explicitly checking for conditions before executing the code.\n",
