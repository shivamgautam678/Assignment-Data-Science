    "#     An object, on the other hand, is an instance of a class. \n",
    "#     It is a concrete representation of the class, created using the blueprint provided by the class.\n",
    "#     Each object has its own unique identity and state, and can perform actions based on the defined behaviors of its class.\n",

    "# Q2. Name the four pillars of OOPs.\n",
    "# Ans: The four pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data (attributes) and the methods (behaviors) that operate on that\n",
    "#                data into a single unit called a class.\n",
    "#                It allows data hiding, meaning that the internal representation and implementation details of an object are\n",
    "#                hidden from the outside, and access to the object's data and methods is controlled through a well-defined interface. \n",
    "#                Encapsulation helps in organizing and managing complex codebases, promoting modularity, and protecting data integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Inheritance: Inheritance is the mechanism that allows a class to inherit the properties (attributes and methods) of another\n",
    "#              class. The class that is being inherited from is called the superclass or base class, and the class that inherits from \n",
    "#              it is called the subclass or derived class. Inheritance facilitates code reuse, as the subclass can extend or specialize\n",
    "#              the functionality of the superclass. It promotes hierarchical classification and helps in creating more manageable and \n",
    "#              structured code.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Polymorphism: Polymorphism means the ability of an object to take on multiple forms or behaviors. In OOP, polymorphism allows \n",
    "#               objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. This allows a single interface\n",
    "#               or method to be used to manipulate objects of different types. Polymorphism is achieved through method overriding\n",
    "#               (involving the same method name in different classes with different implementations) and method overloading \n",
    "#               (involving multiple methods with the same name but different parameters). It promotes code flexibility,\n",
    "#                extensibility, and modularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "            \n",
    "# Abstraction: Abstraction involves the concept of creating simplified, high-level representations of complex systems or objects.\n",
    "#              It focuses on the essential features of an object, ignoring the unnecessary details. In OOP, abstraction is \n",
    "#              achieved through abstract classes and interfaces. An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and\n",
    "#              serves as a blueprint for subclasses. It can contain abstract methods that have no implementation, leaving it to\n",
    "#              the subclasses to provide the specific implementation. An interface is a collection of abstract methods that \n",
    "#              define a contract, which classes can implement. Abstraction helps in managing complexity, promoting modularity,\n",
